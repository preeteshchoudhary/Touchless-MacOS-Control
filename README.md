# Touchless-MacOS-Control

Touchless-MacOS-Control is a hands-free control system for macOS that enables users to interact with their computer using **gesture recognition** and **voice commands**. Leveraging MediaPipe for real-time gesture detection and Google Speech Recognition for voice commands, this project provides an intuitive, touchless interface to perform common system actions.

---

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** Detects predefined hand gestures via webcam to trigger system actions.
- **Voice Control:** Recognizes voice commands to perform actions without touching the keyboard or mouse.
- **AppleScript Integration:** Executes macOS system commands through AppleScript for seamless control.
- **Real-time Video Preview:** Displays live webcam feed with gesture detection feedback.
- **Configurable Commands:** Easily customize gestures and voice commands via YAML configuration files.

## AppleScript Actions

AppleScript files located in `core/system/applescripts/` define system actions. You can add or modify scripts to extend functionality.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Microphone or Camera not detected:**  
  Ensure your macOS privacy settings allow access to these devices.

- **Gesture not recognized:**  
  Make sure your webcam is properly connected and the lighting is sufficient.

- **Voice commands not recognized:**  
  Speak clearly and ensure your microphone is working.

- **Permission errors:**  
  Confirm that Terminal or your IDE has Accessibility and Automation permissions.
